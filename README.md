Congratulations, youâ€™ve fallen headfirst into my little corner of the void.
This Profile merely exists to give you some kind of Info on me (May Not be helpful Info).  
Iâ€™m 18, ENTP, and thriving on a suspicious mix of curiosity and mischief. If reality had a reset button, Iâ€™d press it just to watch everyone scramble.

This profile is proudly void of code, logic, and any semblance of order.  
Here, the only constants are questionable choices, dramatic flair, and the lingering suspicion that Iâ€™m up to something (I am).

Stuck here? Excellent.  
Sign my atabook before you escapeâ€”think of it as leaving a cryptic note in a locked room.  
Maybe itâ€™ll confuse the next traveller. Maybe itâ€™ll confuse me. Either way, chaos wins.
