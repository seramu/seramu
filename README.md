Ah, you've stumbled into my little pocket of the internet.  
I'm 18, ENTP, and if life were a game, I'd already be trying to glitch through the walls just to see what happens.

This profile? Utterly devoid of code.  
It's here solely for game-related shenanigans, dramatic entrances, and the occasional existential crisis (optional, but recommended).

Before you vanish into the digital mist, leave your mark and sign my atabook.  
Who knowsâ€”maybe your signature will be the clue to lifeâ€™s greatest mystery. Or at least a good laugh.
